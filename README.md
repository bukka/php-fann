# The PHP FANN (Fast Artificial Neural Network) Extension

This is a PHP binding for [FANN (Fast Artificial Neural Network) library](http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/).

## API

The API is very similar to the official [FANN C API](http://leenissen.dk/fann/html/files/fann-h.html). Just functions for fixed `fann_type` have not been mapped because PHP always support `float`. In addition unnecessary arguments for some functions have been left out (for example array length that is not necessary for PHP arrays).

## Installation

First download the source
```
git clone https://github.com/bukka/php-fann.git
```

Before you start installation make sure that `libfann` is installed on your system. It's part of the main repository in the most Linux distributions (search for `fann`). If not you need to install it first. Either download it from the [official site](http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/) or get it from your distro repository. For example in Fedora:
```
sudo yum install fann-devel
```
Then go to the created source directory and compile the extension. You need to have a php development package installed (command `phpize` must be available).
```
cd php-fann
phpize
./configure --with-fann
make
sudo make install
```

Finally you need to add
```
extension=fann.so
```
to the php.ini

## Examples

These are just two basic examples for simple training and running supplied data on the trained network.

### `simple_train.php`

```php
$num_input = 2;
$num_output = 1;
$num_layers = 3;
$num_neurons_hidden = 3;
$desired_error = 0.001;
$max_epochs = 500000;
$epochs_between_reports = 1000;

$ann = fann_create_standard($num_layers, $num_input, $num_neurons_hidden, $num_output);

if ($ann) {
    fann_set_activation_function_hidden($ann, FANN_SIGMOID_SYMMETRIC);
    fann_set_activation_function_output($ann, FANN_SIGMOID_SYMMETRIC);

    $filename = dirname(__FILE__) . "/xor.data";
    if (fann_train_on_file($ann, $filename, $max_epochs, $epochs_between_reports, $desired_error))
        fann_save($ann, dirname(__FILE__) . "/xor_float.net");

    fann_destroy($ann);
}
```
### `simple_test.php`

```php
$train_file = (dirname(__FILE__) . "/xor_float.net");
if (!is_file($train_file))
    die("The file xor_float.net has not been created! Please run simple_train.php to generate it");

$ann = fann_create_from_file($train_file);
if (!$ann)
	die("ANN could not be created");

$input = array(-1, 1);
$calc_out = fann_run($ann, $input);
printf("xor test (%f,%f) -> %f\n", $input[0], $input[1], $calc_out[0]);
fann_destroy($ann);
```

## Documentation

The documentation is currently available at [http://bukka.eu/php/doc/book.fann.html](http://bukka.eu/php/doc/book.fann.html). It's not been styled because I would like to add it to the officail PHP site in the future. Be aware that the links to other PHP sections (e.g. PHP Manual) does not work (the documentation is generated from DocBook and only fann part is saved on the site). However the links on the fann API documentation pages works as expected.
